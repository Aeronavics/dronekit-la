TEST: Any Parameters Seen
Description: This test will FAIL if the input does not contain parameter information.
* Pass: Parameters seen

TEST: Good EKF
Description: This test will FAIL or WARN if EKF variances exceed the respective thresholds, or FAIL if the EKF status flags indicate errors.
* Fail: The EKF status report indicates a problem with the EKF
* Fail: pos_horiz_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Fail: compass_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Fail: pos_vert_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Fail: velocity_variance exceeds fail threshold
* Warn: compass_variance exceeds warn threshold
* Warn: pos_horiz_variance exceeds warn threshold
* Warn: velocity_variance exceeds warn threshold

TEST: Ever Armed
Description: This test will FAIL if the craft did not arm
* Pass: The vehicle armed

TEST: Attitude Control
Description: This test will FAIL or WARN if the vehicle's desired attitudes and achieved attitudes are not within threshold delta values for more than a threshold time.
* Fail: Desired attitude not achieved
* Warn: Desired attitude not achieved

TEST: Battery
Description: This test will FAIL if the battery level falls below the battery failsafe threshold level, or if a battery failsafe event is received.
* Pass: Battery never below failsafe

TEST: AutoPilot Health
Description: This test will FAIL if problems are detected with the AutoPilot

TEST: GPS Fix
Description: This test will FAIL if the quality of the GPS information is poor
* Fail: No 3D fix was ever acquired
* Pass: First 3D GPS Fix Acquired

TEST: Ever Flew
Description: This test will FAIL if the craft did not ever seem to fly
* Pass: The vehicle appeared to fly

TEST: Velocity Estimate Divergence
Description: This test will FAIL if various craft's velocity estimates diverge

TEST: Crash Test
Description: This test will FAIL if the vehicle appears to crash
* Fail: Vehicle is past maximum allowed angle and running its motors

TEST: Altitude Estimate Divergence
Description: This test will FAIL or WARN if the various vehicle's Altitude estimates diverge
* Fail: This altitude estimate differs from the canonical craft altitude
* Warn: This altitude estimate differs from the canonical craft altitude

TEST: Vehicle Definition
Description: This test will FAIL if the craft type is never defined
* Pass: Vehicle was appropriately defined

TEST: Brownout
Description: This test will FAIL if the craft appears to lose onboard power during a flight
* Fail: Log ended while craft still flying

TEST: Position Estimate Divergence
Description: This test will FAIL if various craft's position estimates diverge
* Fail: This position estimate differs from the canonical craft position

TEST: Compass Vector Length
Description: This test will FAIL or WARN if the compass vector length exceeds the respective threshold.  Possible causes include flying near large metal objects.

TEST: Arming Checks
Description: This test will FAIL if the craft ever arms when some arming checks are disabled

TEST: Sensor Health
Description: This test will FAIL if any sensor is detected as failed
* Fail: The craft's assessment of its sensors indicate a problem

TEST: Attitude Estimate Divergence
Description: This test will FAIL if various craft's attitude estimates diverge
* Fail: This attitude estimate differs from the canonical craft attitude

TEST: Compass Offsets
Description: This test will WARN or FAIL depending on the degree that compass offset parameters exceed specified thresholds.
* Fail: Compass offsets in parameters are out of bounds

Adding new tests (FIXME)
---------------
Duplicate a test, change the obvious stuff
Ensure the paket types you are interested in are being handled in:
 - mavlink_message_handler.h
 - ensure mavlink_reader.cpp mentions your packet type in handle_message_received
 - ensure analyze.h mentions the appropriately-signaured functions

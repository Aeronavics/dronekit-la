Updating is still a manual process.

1.  Clone 3drobotics/mavlink-solo somewhere and cd to it
2.  make a c_library subdir
3.  ./mavgenerate.py
    Out=(browse to c_library), Language=C, Protocol=1.0, Validate=yes
    Select each xml file in message_definitions/v1.0 in turn and Generate:
        ardupilotmega.xml
        ASLUAV.xml
        autoquad.xml
        common.xml
        matrixpilot.xml
        minimal.xml
        pixhawk.xml
        slugs.xml
        test.xml
        ualberta.xml
4.  Delete the existing SoloLink/flightcode/mavlink/c_library and copy the new
    one there.

The problem I was having with command-line generation was that when starting
pymavlink/tools/mavgen.py, it would end up using the version of itself
installed on my host and something would go awry. There is probably an easy
fix.

The ultimate goal is for bitbake to do this, install the headers in the
sysroot, then have the flight code build against that.
